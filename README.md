🤝 Collaborative Coding: Seamlessly collaborate with multiple developers on the same project in real-time. Enhance productivity and creativity through synchronized coding sessions.

📹 Video Rooms: Engage in immersive video rooms with integrated screen sharing, mic, and camera controls. Collaborate effectively without leaving the coding environment.

🖥️ Layout Customization: Customize your workspace with flexible layout options. Adapt the view to your preferences for an optimized coding experience.

🔒 Secure Authentication: I've integrated Clerk for authentication, ensuring a secure and hassle-free login experience. Protect your data and enjoy seamless user interactions.
